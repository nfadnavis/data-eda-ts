# Data Cleaning and EDA with Time Series - Assignment 2.1: Data Cleaning and EDA with Time Series Data
This repository contains the code and analysis for Assignment 2.1: Data Cleaning and EDA with Time Series Data, part of the AAI 530 course.

**Overview**
This assignment focuses on cleaning and exploring time series data from the Individual Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset. Key objectives include:

Data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting datetime columns).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with time series visualizations.
Computing and analyzing monthly and moving averages.
Investigating covariance and correlation between variables.
**Dataset**
The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains four years of household power consumption data.

***Key Features of the Analysis****
**Data Cleaning:**
Combined Date and Time columns into a Datetime column.
Converted numeric columns and handled missing values.
**EDA:**
Visualized raw data and patterns over time.
Computed and plotted monthly and 30-day moving averages.
Examined distributions and outliers using histograms and boxplots.
Covariance and Correlation:
Computed covariance and correlation matrices.
Visualized relationships using scatter matrices and heatmaps.
**File Structure**

**Results**
Identified seasonal trends in power usage.
Highlighted correlations between key variables like Global_active_power and Global_intensity.
Addressed data cleaning issues, such as missing values and formatting.
